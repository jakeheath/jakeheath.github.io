        <h1>The Wonders of Space</h1>
        <img src="images/551082.jpg" alt="image of space and galaxies">
        <p>Space is the biggest wonder of our species. It can easily be described as:</p>
    
        <ul> 
          <li>Beautiful</li>
          <li>Monstorous</li>
          <li>Scary</li>
          <li>Immense</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Of all the things it can be described as, the most accurate of all is simply that it is beyond elegant. It stretches infinitely for all we know, 
            and we don't know. It is filled with uncountable galaxies, stars, planets. Probably thousands of species of intelligent life spread through 
            our universe. </p>
